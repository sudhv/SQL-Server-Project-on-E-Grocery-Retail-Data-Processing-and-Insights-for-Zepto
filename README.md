# SQL-Server-Project-on-E-Grocery-Retail-Data-Processing-and-Insights-for-Zepto


Designed & implemented a relational SQL Server database for e-grocery products, performing data cleaning (unit conversions, NULL handling, invalid data removal) using ETL principles and TCL for transactional integrity.

Utilized advanced SQL queries (joins, window functions, aggregates, CASE) to derive category performance, inventory segmentation (Low/Medium/Bulk weight), and identify top-discounted/high-MRP products.

Resolved data integrity issues (e.g., arithmetic overflows via CAST/BIGINT) and delivered actionable insights: revenue/category estimates, price/gram analysis, and high-value stockout recommendations.
